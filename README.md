# ChainFluxVault

## 🛰️ Chain Flux Protocol
ChainFluxVault is built as an example module inspired by the principles of the **Chain Flux Protocol**, 
a conceptual decentralized liquidity and data-flow network model where assets, value, and state updates 
move through verifiable channels (“flux streams”) across smart contracts.  
This project mimics a simplified flux stream by enabling secure deposit and withdrawal operations while 
maintaining traceable value movement.

## 📌 Project Description
ChainFluxVault is a lightweight Ethereum smart-contract vault that allows users to:
- Deposit ETH into a secure on-chain vault.
- Withdraw stored ETH.
- Check their individual balances at any time.

Built with Solidity and designed to illustrate dependable, minimalistic asset-flow logic.

## 🌍 Project Vision
The vision of ChainFluxVault is to serve as a foundational component in decentralized value-flow networks.  
Future iterations can integrate advanced liquidity routing, multi-asset support, oracle-based triggers, 
and cross-chain flux channels.

---

## ⭐ Key Features
- **Secure ETH Storage** – Users can safely deposit funds.
- **Self-Custodial Withdrawals** – Only owners can withdraw their own balances.
- **Event Logging** – Real-time tracking of all deposit and withdrawal events.
- **Minimal & Auditable** – Small contract footprint for easy verification.

---

## 🔮 Future Scope
- Support for ERC-20 tokens.
- Integration with chain flux protocol automated liquidity channels.
- Time-locked or conditional withdrawals.
- Layer-2 and cross-chain bridging support.
- Enhanced role management and modular upgradeability.
